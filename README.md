#### <a id="project-description"></a> Project description

As a user, I want to log my surfing sessions via a map application.

The application consists of two panels. The **left-side panel** contains the map. The map should be loaded based on the user's current position (via the Geolocation API).

The **right-side panel** will display a formula and a list of logged surf sessions. The formula will appear (on the right side panel) after the user clicks on a position on the map. Additional data can be input into the formula, e.g. title, date, time, duration of surf session, type of surf destination (reef, beach, rock, mixed), rating of surf session, and some text to describe it. The panel could be collapsible. The list of logged surf sessions will always be displayed (below the formula).
